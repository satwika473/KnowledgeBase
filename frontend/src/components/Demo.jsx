            ‚ú® Hello there!
            <br />
            I‚Äôm sorry to hear that you‚Äôre experiencing a migraine. Let‚Äôs see how
            we can help alleviate your symptoms. I‚Äôd like to ask a few questions:
            <ol>
              <li>
                How long have you been experiencing this migraine, and how often
                do they occur?
              </li>
              <li>
                Are there any specific symptoms like nausea, vomiting, or
                sensitivity to light/sound?
              </li>
            </ol>
          </div>

          <div className="user-msg">
            For two days, it occurs every week, sensitivity to light and sound.

          <div className="bot-msg">
            Thanks for that. Sounds like chronic recurrent migraines with
            photophobia and phonophobia. Let me ask:
            <ul>
              <li>How long have you had them?</li>
              <li>What medications have you used?</li>
              <li>Are you allergic to anything?</li>
            </ul>

          <div className="user-msg">
            I‚Äôve been experiencing them for many years. I used Ibuprofen and
            Aspirin but they don‚Äôt help anymore. I take Candesartan. I have
            allergies.
          </div>

          <div className="bot-msg">
            Thanks for the info. Since OTC meds are no longer effective and
            you‚Äôre on Candesartan, it might help to explore more specialized
            options. Here's a tailored treatment overview:
